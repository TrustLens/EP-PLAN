<h2>Dataset</h2>
<img src="/EP-PLAN/examples/sample_datasets/wf/img/wf_overview.jpg">
<br><br>
The dataset contains 33 individuals that describe a workflow for calculating pumping budget using a hydrology model. 
A high level Create Budget plan (CreateBudgetHighLevelPlan) contains a single multi step Execute Hydrology Model that produces teh Budget Variable. This step is further decomposed into a subplan Estimate Pumping Budget Plan. This plan contains steps for collecting well data and calculating the pumping budget. The dataset contains two execution traces, one of which represents a failed execution, terminated at the point of Collect Well Data.  

<p>Note on coverage of EP-Plan terms:  This dataset does not include Communication Specification, Pplicy, and Multi Variable. see the <a href="/EP-PLAN/examples/sample_datasets/iot/">IoT System Dataset</a> for example usage of those terms. </p>


<h2>Executing queries</h2>
<p>
Make sure that you start a resoner as the competency questions make use of inverse properties. 
<br> Note: At the moment, JENA doesn't resolve imports with URIs from w3id.org properly so to load EP-PLAN into your OntModel link directly to one of the download locations on GITHUB for EP-PLAN with PROV-O alignments. You might have the same issues with older versions of Protege. 
</p>

<h2>Competency Questions results</h2>

<p>
Competency questions were first checked manually in Protege with the help of FACT++ reasoner and SnapSPARQL plugins.  
</p>

<h2>JENA-generated results</h2>

Results of executing competency questions against the test dataset can be found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrustLens/EP-PLAN/master/docs/examples/sample_datasets/wf/cq_results/jena_results.txt">HERE</a>.
