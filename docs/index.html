     <h3>Purpose & Intended Use</h3>
      
     <p>The overall purpose of the ontology is to provide a high level model for documenting plans that can be described as a series of sequential inputs and outputs of steps in a form of acyclic graphs. The ontology also covers the modelling of the instantiation of plans (e.g. an execution trace of a workflow), which is achieved via tight alignment with the PROV-O ontology. Such descriptions are useful for documenting the expected and the actual behaviour of complex data processing systems (e.g. an IoT infrastructure), scientific experiments (e.g. an executable scientific workflows), as well as various protocols that are to date predominately stored in its paper form (e.g. a lab protocol of an experiment).</p>  
     <p>The P-PLAN vocabulary is intended for documenting the expected and actual behaviour of arbitrary systems, however, the plan elements are not strictly designed to guide the execution of processes (e.g. within a scientific workflow platform). The ontology is expected to be useful for scientists and developers, who wish to enhance the transparency of protocols and computational systems through the means of providing meta descriptions, which can be queried by both human users and automated agents. 
     We foresee the main application of the ontology in scenarios where information about systems is sought to facilitate data integration and reuse, pattern mining, and assessments (e.g. trust, privacy, security, quality, etc.). </p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      
     The EP-PLAN ontology builds on two pre-existing ontologies, namely <a href="http://purl.org/net/p-plan">P-PLAN</a>  and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">W3C recommendation PROV-O</a>.
